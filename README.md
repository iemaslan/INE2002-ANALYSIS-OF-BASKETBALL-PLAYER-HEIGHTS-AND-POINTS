# Analysis of Basketball Player Heights and Points

Abstract

This project presents an in-depth statistical analysis of basketball player data, focusing on their heights, points (PTS), and nationalities. Various statistical methods including t-tests, ANOVA, Wilcoxon test, and Spearman correlation were employed to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Visual representations such as scatter plots and pie charts were created to illustrate relationships and distributions effectively. The findings provide valuable information about the characteristics and performance metrics of the players.
